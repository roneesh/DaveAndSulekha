        I turned 28 recently, and I came to a pretty major realization: You have to put things back out into the world. And you won't do it great right away, and it never starts off to your tastes, but you keep on and eventually it becomes something. Dave and Sulekha is that for me, one of my ways of giving back to the communities that have inspired me and made me grow. It's part of my dialogue with the world around me, and it's my sincere hope that you take our fine wares with you as you make your place in this world.

        Dave and Sulekha is named for my uncle Dave and aunt Sulekha. They were the two who gave me my first indication that dress mattered. I can still vividly remember them getting ready for parties, my uncle's signature scent (Halston), his tailored blazer, my aunt's glittery saree, it seemed like an exotic world, and I wanted to be part. Later, I began exploring my family history more, and I learned about my grandfathers, and their approaches to dress, and it grounded me. I realized that I actually I came from a lineage of men of substance. That's why I namd my lines after them, as a sign of respect, and as a promise to myself, to be a man of substance like them.
